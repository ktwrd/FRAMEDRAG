# FRAMEDRAG
A 2D Game Engine/Framework written for MonoGame, heavily influenced from the Javascript Framework [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/).

## Demos
There are currently 2 working demos for FRAMEDRAG.
- [FRAMEDRAG.DVDExample](FRAMEDRAG.DVDExample/)
    - ~~An example of the famous Bouncing DVD Screensaver, but not the DVD Logo. It's a good example of dynamically adding [DisplayObject](Engine/Display/DisplayObject.cs)s that get rendered as soon as they're a child whos root parent is the [Stage](Engine/Display//Stage.cs).~~ This was working when FRAMEDRAG was initially in development but it doesn't work anymore due to major changes in [EngineGame.cs](Engine/EngineGame.cs).
- [FRAMEDRAG.ChessExample](FRAMEDRAG.ChessExample/)
    - An example of a very basic Chess game. It's barely working, mostly due to having enough spare time to develop it. It's a (somewhat) good example of user interactivity.
